Task1:
🚀 Java ATM System - A Hands-On Project 🚀

I've just completed an exciting Java project - a console-based ATM system! 💼

Key Features:

-Secure user authentication with a username and PIN.
-Support for transactions like withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.
-Transaction history tracking, so users can review their financial activity.
-A user-friendly interface with input validation for a smooth experience.
-I've used object-oriented programming principles to create modular and maintainable code. 💡

This Java program simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system. It's designed to provide users with a secure and user-friendly banking experience. Let's dive into how it works:

User Authentication:

Users are prompted to enter their ID and PIN for authentication.
Predefined username: "Demo" and password: "123".
Main Menu:

Upon successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of banking operations.
Options include Transaction History, Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and Quit.
Transaction History:

Users can view their transaction history, displaying the type of transaction (Withdraw, Deposit, or Transfer), the transaction amount, and the updated balance.
Withdrawal:

Users can withdraw funds from their account.
The program checks if the withdrawal amount is within the account balance and updates the balance accordingly.
Deposit:

Users can make deposits into their account.
The program updates the balance after the deposit is made.
Transfer:

Users can transfer funds to another account.
The program validates if the transfer amount is within the account balance and updates the balance accordingly.
Quit:

Users can exit the ATM system.
Transaction History:

The program keeps a record of each transaction with details and displays it upon user request.
Loop for Multiple Transactions:

The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple transactions in a single session.
Users can choose to continue or exit the system after each transaction.

This project not only sharpened my Java skills but also enhanced my understanding of software development. Building a functional ATM system from scratch was both challenging and rewarding. 💪

Feel free to take a look at the code here and explore the inner workings of this project. I'm open to feedback and discussions about how we can improve it further! 🙌
